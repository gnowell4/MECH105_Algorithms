### Special Matrix Algorithm
This algorithm creates a matrix given two input values which follow constraints highlighted in the `Special Matrix` directory.

### Root Finding Algorithm
This algorithm estimates the root of a function using the false position method.

### LU Factorization Algorithm
This algorithm takes a coefficient matrix made by the user and results in the lower triangular matrix, the upper triangular matrix as well as the pivot matrix.

### Simpson's 1/3 Algorithm
This algorithm uses the simpson's 1/3 rule in order to calculate the integral of a set of equally spaced tabular data.

### Linear Regression Algorithm
This algorithm creates the linear regression line for a set of tabular data as well as info of the line as well.
